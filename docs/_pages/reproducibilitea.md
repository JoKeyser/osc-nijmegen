ReproducibiliTea is a global initiative bringing journal clubs on reproducibilitea and open science to, at the time of writing, about 20 countries spread over 4 continents. There is more information on the initiative and current chapter on the [ReproducibiliTea website](https://reproducibilitea.org/). The Nijmegen club is scheduled to kick off mid-January 2020.

## Objectives
- learn about cool papers/initiatives etc. related to open open science and reproducibility
- have friendly and engaging discussions about open science and reproducibility
- meet new people interested in these topics in the Radboud campus
- :tea: :tea: :tea:

## Practical info
The journal club will meet monthly every third Wednesday of the month at 16:00. The person who suggested the topic of discussion will introduce it in 10 minutes or under and then we discuss! Meetings will last no longer than an hour.

## Schedule
Stay tuned! The schedule for all upcoming meeting will be shown here. The next ReproducibiliTea will also be shown in the Agenda.

## Inclusivity
Everyone is welcome :blush:

We want to hear from anyone who's interested in open science and reproducibility (pro or against) regardless of background, discipline, and career stage.
