## Goals

- meet new colleagues and have fun
- improve www.openscience-nijmegen.nl
- learn [Git](https://git-scm.com/)/[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) along the way
- spur new project ideas

## Some basics
- everyone is welcome to join
- [registration](https://forms.gle/mWaCpnQ1ncTqF9Kn7) is not mandatory, but very helpful to the organizers
- you can stay as long as you want/can
- we (organizers) will provide coffee and food during the break

### What are the prerequisites? :white_check_mark:

There really only is one:

*Bring your own laptop* (or, well, whatever device you're comfortable working
with) that you can connect to the internet.

### What can you learn at the event?

Once you dig in the [issues](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues), you'll be more comfortable writing and publishing in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (if you aren't already).
Also, hopefully phrases like 'oh, the code is on my [repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-repositories)' and 'just [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo and do a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)' will make a bit more sense (if they don't already). :blush:

### Useful external resources

- [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [version control vs. git vs. GitHub](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) (Git Handbook)

### On-site workflow :repeat:

- find the [issue](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues) you'd like to work on  
- you work on any way you like (e.g. writing in google docs or your text favourite editor)  
- once you're happy with your work, you [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) ('copy') the [OSCN repository](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen) and make changes to your fork  
- then create a [pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to our repository to include your changes into the OSCN repository  
- somebody reviews your contribution
- after a successful review, contribution is live!
- go back to step one :blush:

### Timeline :clock3:

(14.45-15.00 site setup, krank-up laptops, finding plugs :electric_plug: etc.)

15.00-15.10 :coffee: coffee and intro  
15.10-16.00 :wrench: doing (see possible contributions below)  
16.00-16.10 :pizza: break, stretch, food! (or keep on doing)  
16.00-16.50 :wrench: more doing (see contributions below)  
16.50-17.00 :tada: wrap up and plan ahead  

## How can you contribute?

### Contents :pencil:

Contribute by writing new contents and updating existing ones. No coding skills needed. Just eagerness and team spirit ðŸ˜Š

Example issues (those with 'contents' tag):
-	[code of conduct](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/14)
-	[populate OS resources tab](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/6) (find links)
-	[mention OSC Netherlands in about](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/20)
-	[update contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/21)
-	[review and proofread links subpage](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/15)
-	your original issue :blush:

### Website functionality :nut_and_bolt:

Feel like the website is missing something (a button somewhere for something, a tab
for something somewhere?). Jump right in. Tackling these issues will will be easiest
if you are familiar with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). We're using the [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll template.

Example issues:

- [optimize landing page](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/22)
- test search functionality
- explore options for analytics (yes/no)
- your issue :blush:

### Website organization :bookmark:

If you're happy with buttons and search bars, but think we're missing out on
something altogether, give your contribution here. The current organization is a
result of on-the-go building, so there's certainly room for improvement.

Example issues:

-	[explore options to have a member profiles page](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/16)  
- [create a newsletter archive](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/18)  
- [past events page](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/19)  
-	[devise a system for categorizing contributions](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/17)  
-	[create a member initiatives (sub)page](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/23)  
-	do we want a blog/news subpage?  
-	can we have a tag system?
-	your very own issue :blush:

### Other :watermelon:
By definition, we don't know what we could do here. But you might. If so, shoot!
