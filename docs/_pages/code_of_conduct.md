The Open Science Community Nijmegen (OSCN) organizes, promotes, and facilitates open science events to enable its members and others that are interested to learn about and discuss open science practices, share open science knowledge, and build professional networks. OSCN is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender identity, gender expression, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, appearance, religion, or other group status. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.


OSCN is dedicated to diversity, equity, inclusion, and the free expression of ideas. OSCN seeks to provide an environment in which diverse participants may learn, discuss, network, and enjoy each other's company in an environment of mutual respect. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and hold that environment for the benefit of all. Some behaviors, therefore, are specifically prohibited:


- Harassment or intimidation based on gender identity, gender expression, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, appearance, religion, or other group status.
- Sexual harassment or intimidation, including unwelcome sexual attention, stalking (physical or virtual), or unsolicited physical contact.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Sustained disruption of events.
- Threatening organizers (verbally or physically).


Organizers are asked to frame discussions as openly and inclusively as possible and to be aware of how language or images may be perceived by others.


Critical examination of beliefs and viewpoints does not, by itself, constitute hostile conduct or harassment. Similarly, use of sexual imagery or language in the context of a professional discussion might not constitute hostile conduct or harassment if it is necessary to the topic of discussion and presented respectfully.



### Enforcement

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.


If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.


Violations of this code of conduct may lead to termination of the membership of the Open Science Community Nijmegen.


Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.


We expect participants to follow these rules at all events and event-related social activities.



### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you believe a harassment problem exists, please report it as soon as possible to contact@openscience-nijmegen.nl. (If something happens at an event, you may additionally want to report it to the event organizers.) We will then fully investigate the issue and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence. When making a personal report, we will make sure your report is managed properly and respectfully. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.
