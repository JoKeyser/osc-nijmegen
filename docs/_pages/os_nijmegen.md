## General

* **What is open science?**
*"Open science is the practising of science in a sustainable manner which gives others the opportunity to work with, contribute to and make use of the scientific process. This allows users 'from outside of the science world' to influence the research world with questions and ideas and help gather research data."*

## Preregistration  
### What is preregistration? 

Preregistration describes the  practice of specifying hypotheses, study conditions, pre-processing pathways, and analyses prior to data analysis. The general purpose of preregistration is to increase transparency and increase the ease of evaluation of the sincerity of statistical tests.

### When is preregistration useful?
Preregistration is useful for **confirmatory** research, i.e., research that has clear hypotheses, a clear analysis pipeline, and clear expectations about the effect size the sample size required to obtain it. If some of these infos are missing, one should careful consider whether one is in the position to successfully preregister one's research.

There have recently been some debates about the usefulness of preregistration, at all. Even if a phenomenon can be successfully observed as predicted, it is not clear what can be learned from this phenomenon.  

* Debates surrounding preregistration:
    * [Nosek, B. A., Beck, E. D., Campbell, L., Flake, J. K., Hardwicke, T. E., Mellor, D. T., ... & Vazire, S. (2019). Preregistration is hard, and worthwhile. _Trends in Cognitive Sciences_, 23(10), 815-818.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661319301846)

    * [Navarro, D. (2020). Paths in strange spaces: A comment on preregistration. _psyArXiv._](https://psyarxiv.com/wxn58)
* Reasons why to preregister:

### What is a Registered Report?

A Registered Report describes a scientific paper in which the theoretical framework, hypotheses, sample size justifications, study procedure and analyses are submitted to a journal and evaluated by expert reviewers prior to data collection. Papers accepted as Registered Reports will be published regardless of the findings as the study provided the study followed the approved study plan. Therefore, Registered Reports  reduce publication bias ([Scheel et al., 2021](https://psyarxiv.com/p6e9c)).

## Open access

* **What is open access?** 
Open access means that academic information (i.e. your publication or data) is freely accessible to everyone in the world. This means that anyone can read, download, copy, distribute, print, search for and search within the information, or use it in education or in any other way within the legal agreements. See also: https://www.ru.nl/library/services/research/open-access/open-science-explained/open-access/

* **What are my options to publish open access?**
There are different ways to publish in open access. You can either publish at full open access publishers (Gold open access), at hybrid journals (subscription journals that also offer to publish in open access), or via the [Radboud Repository](https://www.ru.nl/library/services/research/open-access/radboud-repository/) (Green open access). The Max Planck institute has its own [repository](https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/).

* **Does it always cost money to publish open access?**
No. If you publish Green open access (also called the "green route") you don't pay any article processing charge (APC). In this case you need to make sure that your publication or data is findable in an open, online repository (see above). However, do take into account embargo periods of academic journals. They sometimes probihit you from sharing your paper until the embargo period has passed.

    In addition, the VSNU (collective of Dutch universities) has made deals with several publishers to give discounts on APCs researchers affiliated to universities in The Netherlands. You can find out more about these deals here: https://libguides.ru.nl/openaccess.
    
    Similarly, the Max Planck Institute also has a list of open access agreements with publishers: https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/21-specials/50-open-access-publishing.html 

* **Do I have to publish open access?**
That depends. As researcher of the Radboud University / Radboudumc you are not obliged to publish open access. However, if you receive funding (part or whole) for your research, your funder may require you to publish open access. For example NWO, EU, WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are strongly advocating open access. Always check the funding conditions at the website of your funder.

* **What support does Radboud University offer me regarding open access publishing?**
You can find general open access information, specific information about VSNU open access deals, and further support, via the libguide here: https://libguides.ru.nl/openaccess/

    [Open Access Support, RU Library](mailto:openaccess@ubn.ru.nl): Offers help surrounding open access, deals and discounts with publishers. 
    [Radboud Repository Support, RU Library](mailto:repository@ubn.ru.nl): Offers help surrounding archiving your publications in the Radboud Repository. 

## Copyright

* **What does CC-BY mean?**
Creative Commons (CC) licences aims to make creative works more freely available than is possible through traditional copyright. The idea is that works such as publications can be copied and distributed more easily or that others can elaborate on them.

    To distinguish the several CC licenses that can be used, you can consult the Guide to Creative Commons for Scholarly Publications and Educational Resources here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4090922

* **How can the library support me to choose the correct licence?**
You can contact the [Copyright Information Point (CIP), RU Library](mailto:copyright@ubn.ru.nl) for help surrounding the rights to your or others publishable work.
