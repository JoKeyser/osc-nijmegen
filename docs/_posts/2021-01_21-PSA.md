In this talk Dr. [Chris Chartier](https://christopherchartier.com/), the founder and director of the PSA will inform you about the basic principles and mission of the PSA, introduce past studies conducted by the PSA, and showcase recent work by the PSA aimed at understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying the Covid-19 pandemic.
