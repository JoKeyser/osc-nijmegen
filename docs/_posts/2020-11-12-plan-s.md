Plan S is an initiative to accelerate the transition to open access publishing. The guidelines of this initiative will be implemented by major funders (i.e. NWO) from 2021. In this webinar, Open Science Manager Dirk van Gorp and Open Access Officer Jeroen Bos will explain the latest features of Plan S and what this means for researchers. There will also be time for questions & answers.
