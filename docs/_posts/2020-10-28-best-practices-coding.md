**What**: Make your code more readable through best coding practices - by Arushi Garg (Donders Institute)

Have you ever looked at a script you wrote two years ago and been totally clueless? Or do you hesitate to share your code with others out of fear that it's too cryptic? Come and join our best coding practices workshop and learn how to make your code more readable!

Our speaker for this event is Arushi Garg. She is currently doing a PhD at the Donders Institute. In her past life, she worked in the software industry as a developer for three years, where she was required to follow rigorous coding standards. In this talk, she draws from her experience and will show us how we can employ such practices in science and make reproducibility and sharing a breeze.

See you there! :wave: :sparkles:
