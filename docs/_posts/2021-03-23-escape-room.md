**What**: Learn about data management and sharing while escaping Professor Hutseephluts's office

Does data management sound scary to you? Wait until youâ€™ve done this escape room! Data managers from the VU have developed an online game where you can explore the horrors of bad data management, and teach you how to improve your data management. We will make teams of 2-4 persons with whom you can participate in the escape room together. A great way to meet new OS-enthusiasts. 
The escape room takes approximately one hour. No research data management knowledge or experience is needed. Come try it out, if you dare!
