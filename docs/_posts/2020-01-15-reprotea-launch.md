**When**: 15 January 2020 from 15:00 to 16:00

**Where**: Room A229 at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (Wundtlaan 1, 6525 XD Nijmegen)

**What**: The very first meeting of ReproducibiliTea Nijmegen! ReproducibiliTea 
In this first meeting we'll start with the basics.
We'll introduce ourselves and ReproducibiliTea and then Johannes will briefly present our first paper: "False positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibililty in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant" by Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn (2011).
You can read this [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611417632).
We chose this article because it's had great impact on discussions of open science and reproducibility over the last (almost) decade.
It's also quite short :wink:
If time allows, we'll go over the schedule for future meetings.
Eirini and Johannes have already thought of some articles to discuss next but we want these discussions to reflect the interests of the attendees - you!
