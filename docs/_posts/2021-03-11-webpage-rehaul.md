**When**: Thursday, 11 March, and Monday, March 15, both from 15:00 to 17:00

**Where**: Online! Register [here for the March 11 session](https://forms.gle/zNbQ33zs8JCiymZ86) and [here for the March 15 session](https://forms.gle/ZgG3RtcZzu446PDT9) to get the link and password.

**What**: Help us improve the resources page on our OSCN webpage!

It’s time for a spring makeover for our website. Especially the [Resources](https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/_pages/os_nijmegen/) page could do with an update. We want to transform this into a Frequently Asked Questions page that provides short, to the point answers to questions and how-to’s about open science, and link to pages with further information. 
Everyone in our community is welcome to join this session! We will start with a brainstorm and task division, and then work on separate tasks for the remainder of the session. No coding or website-building experience is required.
You can join both sessions, or just one of them. 

To receive the Zoom-link, please sign up [here for the March 11 session](https://forms.gle/zNbQ33zs8JCiymZ86) and [here for the March 15 session](https://forms.gle/ZgG3RtcZzu446PDT9).

See you there! :wave: :sparkles:
